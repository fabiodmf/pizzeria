## About

Pizzeria is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that lets users order pizzas online. This project was a screening test task for a potential job opportunity I pursued for a German-based company.

## Getting Started: Build

To run the application locally in a development environment, start by running the following command(s) to start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Main features: Develop/Test

At the moment, the following features exist in the app:

- Viewing the menu page with many pizza items.
- Currency switch feature with Russian Ruble, USD, and Euro as the options.
- Login/Registration forms with proper validation.
- User is able to add multiple items in cart and update quantities.
- Guest user is allowed (login not mandatory).
